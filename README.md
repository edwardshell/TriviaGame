# TriviaGame

You have 90 seconds to finsih the quiz and the clock starts once the page loads.


It is a music trivia game consisiting of 6 questions. 

I had problems getting the number of correct and wrong to add together right. I belive its my "on clicks" that are the problem.

Using setTimeouts, timers, and all the jquery helped me gain a slilghtly better understanding of them.
